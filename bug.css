The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if the calculation results in a value that is not a valid CSS length, it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, attempting to subtract a larger value from a smaller value will result in a negative value, which is not a valid length in CSS. This can manifest in unpredictable layout behavior or even cause the entire CSS rule to be ignored by the browser.
